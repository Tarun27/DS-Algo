/**
 * Amazon Games has introduced an exciting new game that revolves around dominoes! ðŸŽ² The game consists of n dominoes, each having a 
   distinct size represented by an array tiles.
 * In this game, the "order" of the dominoes is defined as the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (LIS) formed by their sizes.
 * Additionally, there is another array removalOrder, which contains integers ranging from 0 to n-1. These integers indicate the positions
   of dominoes that can be removed one by one in the specified sequence.
 * Your objective is to determine the maximum number of removals that can be performed while ensuring that the order (LIS) of the 
   remaining dominoes remains at least a given threshold minOrder.
   
 * Parameters -
 
 * int tiles[n] â€“ an array of n integers representing the sizes of dominoes.
 
 * int removalOrder[n] â€“ an array specifying the sequence in which the dominoes should be removed.
 
 * int minOrder â€“ an integer representing the minimum required LIS that must be maintained after removals.
 
 * Return -
 * The function should return a single integer, which represents the maximum number of removals possible while keeping the longest 
   strictly increasing subsequence at least minOrder.
 * 
   Example 1:
 * Input:  tiles = [1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 3], removalOrder = [2, 1, 4, 0, 5, 3], minOrder = 3
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation:
 *
 * In this example, the player can remove dominoes in the order specified by remove. After each removal, the length of the LIS
   of the remaining dominoes should be at least min_order. The task is to find out the maximum number of such removals possible.
